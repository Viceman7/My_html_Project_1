    <h2>What is warcraft 3 ?</h2>

    <div class="warcraft_text">
      <p>
        Warcraft 3 is a real time strategy game (RTS) developed and published by
        blizzard entertainment released in july 2002. It is the second sequel to
        Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, after Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, the third
        game set in the Warcraft fictional universe, and the first to be
        rendered in three dimensions. An expansion pack, The Frozen Throne, was
        released in July 2003.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the game, as in many real-time strategy (RTS) games, players collect
        resources, train individual units and heroes, and build bases in order
        to achieve various goals (in single-player mode), or to defeat the enemy
        player.

        Four playable factions can be chosen from: Humans, Orcs, (both of which
        appeared in the previous games) and two new factions: the Night Elves
        and the Undead. Warcraft III's single-player campaign is laid out
        similarly to that of StarCraft, and is told through the races in a
        progressive manner.
